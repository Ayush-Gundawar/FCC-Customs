                            <p>From 1961 to 1963, Hamilton worked on the <span class="decorate">Semi-Automatic Ground Environment</span> (SAGE) Project at the MIT Lincoln Lab, where she was one of the programmers who wrote software for the prototype, used by the U.S. Air Force to search for possibly unfriendly aircraft.</p>

                            <p>She joined the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, which developed the <span class="decorate">Apollo Guidance</span> Computer for the Apollo lunar exploration program. Hamilton was the first programmer hired for the Apollo project at MIT and the <span class="decorate">first female programmer</span> in the project and later became Director of the Software Engineering Division</p>

                <div class="quoted">
                    "When I first came up with the term, no one had heard of it before, at least in our world. It was an ongoing joke for a long time. They liked to kid me about my radical ideas. It was a memorable day when one of the most respected hardware gurus explained to everyone in a meeting that he agreed with me that the process of building software should also be considered an engineering discipline, just like with hardware. Not because of his acceptance of the new 'term' per se, but because we had earned his and the acceptance of the others in the room as being in an engineering field in its own right."
